Puppet code used to replicate web content between instances: 
  
       file { "/var/www/html":
                ensure  => directory,
                recurse => true,
                mode    => '444',
                owner   => 'root',
                group   => 'root',
                source  => "puppet:///modules/apache2/html",
                require => Package["apache2"],
        }
